          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>The majestic Gwalior Fort, one of India's architectural treasures, towers above Gwalior city on a hilltop. Constructed by leaders of the Kachchhapaghata dynasty during ancient times around the 8th century A.D., this fort is proof of their ability to cultivate visionaries who understood greatness as well as wielded power.
            Throughout its many centuries of existence, the Gwalior Fort has withstood numerous trials, from times of prosperity under ruling dynasties like the Tomaras or Mughals to periods of decline endured under others like the Marathas or Scindias. Despite these chaotic shifts in power over time, though, theyï¿½ve each forged a unique element concerning both their architectural design and overall feel. Spreading across an expanse exceeding 3 sq km, this majestic fortress is characterised by imposing walls that tower above everything else in sight, along with intricate carvings meticulously scribed throughout. The fort's main entrance, known as the Hathi Pol, or Elephant Gate, greets visitors with its massive dimensions and ornate design.</p>
